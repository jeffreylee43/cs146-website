                        <p>
                            The egg and cheese was delicious and the fries on the dish were fresh and good in terms of quality. I would recommend this place because this dish was really good. There was a good bread to egg to cheese ratio, and the fries to added a nice after taste as well.

                            <p>
                                The sliders were delicious and good in terms of quality. I would recommend this place because this dish was really good. There was a good bread to patty ratio, however the presentation of the dish was pretty garbanzo. Good for food not for looks.

                                <p>
                                    The fries were delicious and good in terms of quality. I would recommend this place because this dish was really good. There was a good crispiness on the outside of the fires, while maintaining a nice fluffy center. By far one of the greatest fries that have ever entered my taste pallet.
